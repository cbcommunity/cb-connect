    "# CBTH API Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook will demonstrate the use of the CB ThreatHunter APIs through both using raw APIs and also using the `cbapi` Python module.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE** the support for ThreatHunter in `cbapi` is still under development and the interfaces are subject\n",
    "to change.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two prerequisites for using this code: first, you need credentials to log into the API for your\n",
    "Cb PSC organization; and second, you need the `cbapi` bindings to use this Python code directly. If you\n",
    "want to use another language, or to call the REST API endpoints manually, you won't need to install `cbapi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create connectors in your Cb PSC organization. Log into the console and follow the\n",
    "instructions at https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/cb-defense/authentication/ to create an`API` type connector\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your connector, you'll need the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. URL endpoint (e.g. `defense-prod05.conferdeploy.net`) for the APIs. This is the same URL you would use for the PSC Web UI\n",
    "2. Connector ID and API key for the API connector\n",
    "4. \"Org key\" - this is a unique identifier for your org and is displayed on the top of API Keys page\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install cbapi\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is only if you want to run this code directly. This python script uses the `cbapi`\n",
    "module. The support for ThreatHunter in `cbapi` is being actively developed in a fork available from\n",
    "https://github.com/trailofbits/cbapi-python/tree/tob-cbth. To run this code as-is, you need to `git clone`\n",
    "that repository, change into the `tob-cbth` branch, and install `cbapi` in a virtualenv.\n",
    "\n",
    "`cbapi` uses credential file to read the API secret keys. Whenever you write scripts to interact with the\n",
    "Cb APIs (or any API for that matter) you should **always** keep your API secret keys separate from your script.\n",
    "If your script is ever exposed, either intentionally (by sharing it), or accidentally, then your API token\n",
    "could be compromised if it were embedded inside your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about credential files and `cbapi`, see the docs at https://cbapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#api-credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "More information on configuring `cbapi`:\n",
    "https://cbapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation for the ThreatHunter APIs is now available on the Developer Network website at: https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/cb-threathunter/\n",
    "\n",
    "## Asynchronous Search Model\n",
    "ThreatHunter is based on scalable and multi-tenant architecture that is capable of ingressing tens of millions of events per second. Searches are built to scale and perform.\n",
    "Searches in ThreatHunter are asynchronous. This allows better experience to both API and UI user since search can be initiated quickly and results can be gathered later and incrementally. Another advantage is that results can be referenced over and over, without re-running the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](search.png)\n",
    "1. When customer C1 searches for data through the search API, it is distributed across potentially large number of indices related to that customer and desired time frame, without touching unrelated indices.\n",
    "2. Each index reports results back to the AWS S3 bucket.\n",
    "3. Separate API call is used to retrieve data back. Result payload will always be aggregated and also contain information on the progress of the search.\n"

    "## Querying CBTH\n",
    "\n",
    "As a first example, let's take a look for any processes that match our IOC: Children of `outlook.exe` processes that themselves start powershell. This might point to some malicious application started from the Outlook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Query first has to be placed into Solr syntax. In this case, it will be\n",
    "```\n",
    "parent_name:outlook.exe childproc_name:powershell.exe\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You could, for example, put this query as is in the ThreatHunter Investigate page and get the results. However, let's see how we could do this with APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Curl\n",
    "\n",
    "We will not use Curl in this demo, but here is how it would roughly be done. Details of API token are hidden in these examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since queries are asynchronous, you would issue two requests. First would issue a query and return you a token:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$curl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -H \"X-Auth-Token:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/YYYYYYYYYY\" -XPOST \"https://defense-prod05.conferdeploy.net/threathunter/search/v1/orgs/7YZFGDDN/processes/search_jobs\" -d '{\n",
    "                         \"search_params\": {\n",
    "                             \"q\": \"parent_name:outlook.exe childproc_name:powershell.exe\",\n",
    "                             \"sort\": \"process_name ASC\"\n",
    "                         }}'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note how you can also specify sort\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result of this, you will get something like:\n",
    "```\n",
    "{'query': {'cb.max_backend_timestamp': 1559244344000,\n",
    "           'cb.max_device_timestamp': 1559244344000,\n",
    "           'cb.min_backend_timestamp': 0,\n",
    "           'cb.min_device_timestamp': 0,\n",
    "           'q': '*:*',\n",
    "           'rows': 500,\n",
    "           'sort': 'process_name ASC',\n",
    "           'start': 0},\n",
    " 'query_id': '3e591d5e-6a43-4bae-90d6-76e815227b3d'}\n",
    " ```\n",
    "Then, using query_id token, you can ask for results using Get request:\n",
    "```\n",
    "$curl -H \"X-Auth-Token:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/YYYYYYYYYY\" -XGET \"/threathunter/search/v1/orgs/7YZFGDDN/processes/search_jobs/3e591d5e-6a43-4bae-90d6-76e815227b3d/results?start_row=0&row_count=3\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will give us first up to first 3 results of the query with information on progress to query completion (in case is still running).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using cbapi With Raw Request Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, instead of using raw curl, let's use help of our `cbapi` library to start the same asynchronous query. In the second step, we will actually not use full cbapi entity model, but just underlying session management and HTTP request wrapper. This still allows us to see low-level asynchronous API calls, but is simpler. Best of all, we don't have to keep our credential information inside the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also introduce few more APIs here.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Query Validation\n",
    "Query validation API checks query syntax and makes sure it is valid. This is useful in case we want to make sure our query is using correct syntax and field names. \n",
    "Let's try two validation requests - onewill use invalid syntax (wrong field name) and second will be valid:"
