    "# CBTH Search, Feed & Watchlist Short Demo\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook will provide a brief walkthrough of the search, feed and watchlist fucntionality in CB ThreatHunter. For more detail walkthrough of what is possible via the API please take a look at the other notebooks available in this repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two prerequisites for using this code: first, you need credentials to log into the API for your\n",
    "Cb PSC organization; and second, you need the `cbapi` bindings to use this Python code directly. If you\n",
    "want to use another language, or to call the REST API endpoints manually, you won't need to install `cbapi`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### API Credentials\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step is to create connectors in your Cb PSC organization. Log into the console and follow the\n",
    "instructions at https://developer.carbonblack.com/reference/cb-defense/authentication/ to create an`API` type connector\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have your connector, you'll need the following information:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. URL endpoint (e.g. `defense-prod05.conferdeploy.net`) for the APIs. This is the same URL you would use for the PSC Web UI\n",
    "2. Connector ID and API key for the API connector\n",
    "4. \"Org key\" - this is a unique identifier for your org and is displayed on the top of API Keys page\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install cbapi\n",
    "\n",
    "The second step is only if you want to run this code directly. This python script uses the `cbapi`\n",
    "module. The support for ThreatHunter in `cbapi` is being actively developed in a fork available from\n",
    "https://github.com/trailofbits/cbapi-python/tree/tob-cbth. To run this code as-is, you need to `git clone`\n",
    "that repository, change into the `tob-cbth` branch, and install `cbapi` in a virtualenv.\n",
    "\n",
    "`cbapi` uses credential file to read the API secret keys. Whenever you write scripts to interact with the\n",
    "Cb APIs (or any API for that matter) you should **always** keep your API secret keys separate from your script.\n",
    "If your script is ever exposed, either intentionally (by sharing it), or accidentally, then your API token\n",
    "could be compromised if it were embedded inside your script.\n",
    "\n",
    "To learn more about credential files and `cbapi`, see the docs at https://cbapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#api-credentials.\n",

    "Searches in ThreatHunter are asynchronous. This allows better experience to both API and UI user since search can be initiated quickly and results can be gathered later and incrementally. Another advantage is that results can be referenced over and over, without re-running the search.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the purposes of today's demo we are going to skip over how to access these APIs either directly using something like `curl` and making raw requests leveraging `cbapi` supporting functions. Instead we will jump right to the full `cbapi` supported objects.\n",

    "One way around this is to use `collapse` function available in Solr. In that case, CBTH will try its best to coalesce these results by process when possible, returning only the latest segment.\n",
    "Still, you might still get duplicates in two cases:\n",
    "1. If segments come from different indices\n",
    "2. If there are too many results for Solr to group in each index (threshold for this is currently configured at 1M results)\n",
